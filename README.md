visit the page project on https://danijel-blog.herokuapp.com/ and see how it works

this is my first complete project made from scratch with: HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, Jinja, SQLAlchemy(upgraded to Postgres using Heroku) and deployed online using git control and Heroku services

Project Description:
- this is my blog where I can post any articles
- users can register, log in, once logged in they can read the articles, leave comments, download files and leave a message via contact page
- admin can create new posts, edit existing posts, delete posts and delete comments
- admin can also answer on users messages left via contact page using secret route (email-messages) by sending replies via email(using SMTP protocol)
- login system is using hashing and salting to protect users passwords
- to test the page you can register with fake email as user
